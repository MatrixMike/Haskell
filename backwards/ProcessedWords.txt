I cdnuolt blveiee 
taht I cluod aulaclty uesdnatnrd waht I was rdanieg. The 
phaonmneal pweor of the hmuan mnid Aoccdrnig to rscheearch at 
Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the 
ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoatnt tihng is taht the 
first and last ltteer be in the rghit pclae.. The rset can be a 
taotl mses and you can still raed it wouthit a porbelm. This 
is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by 
istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe. Amzanig huh? 


I couldn't believe that I could actually understand what I was reading. The phenomenal power of the human mind According to research at Cambridge University, it doesn't matter in what order the letters in a word are, the only important thing is that the first and last letter be in the right place. The rest can be a total mess and you can still read it without a problem. This is because the human mind does not read every letter by itself, but the word as a whole. Amazing huh?
